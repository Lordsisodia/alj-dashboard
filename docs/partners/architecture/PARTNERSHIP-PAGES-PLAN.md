- Empty states: Provide helpful copy, “what to do next”, and a CTA per page.
- Performance: Use skeletons; lazy‑load heavy lists (messages, files, portfolio).
- Observability: Emit view/interaction events per page; add error/success events to forms.
- SEO: Internal portal pages are private; public case studies or docs should include canonical titles and descriptions separately.
- Localization: All visible strings in pages above should be wrapped for i18n.

## Open Questions
- Should “Today’s Work” merge tasks + deals into one prioritized list on mobile?
- Which external CRMs or calendars are in scope for v1 integrations?
- What are the SLAs for support response via /partner/support?
- Do we enable saved views for Pipeline and Earnings out of the gate?
