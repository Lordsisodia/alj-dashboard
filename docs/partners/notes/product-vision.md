# Client + Partner Product Vision (2025)

Mobile-first progressive web experience that unifies the **client-base storefront** and the **partners revenue portal** in the same monorepo. This doc replaces the 40-page PRD with the essentials you need to scope, design, or validate features.

## 🎯 Business Goals

| Goal | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue Share | 60% of company revenue sourced via partners | Partners act as the primary sales engine. |
| Onboarding | First partner deal closed within 30 days | Accelerate enablement through training + templates. |
| Retention | 90% 3‑month retention, 75% 6‑month retention | Keep partners active with gamified tiers and support. |
| Mobile Usage | 90% of interactions on mobile PWA | All UX decisions are mobile-first. |

## 🧱 Experience Pillars

1. **Discord-style collaboration** – real-time channels, reactions, file drops, and presence so partners operate like a team.
2. **Tiered progression** – four tiers (Starter → Active → Performer → Elite) that unlock commissions, tooling, and support.
3. **Pipeline + training in one place** – manage leads, log activity, download resources, complete certifications without leaving the app.
4. **Offline-first PWA** – works on flaky networks, sends push/in-app notifications, installable on iOS/Android.

## 🏅 Tier Snapshot

| Tier | Commission | Unlocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter (0‑2 deals) | 20% base | Core dashboard, basic resources, commission tracker. |
| Active (3‑9) | 22% + 5% referral | Lead CRM, analytics, advanced marketing kits, priority support. |
| Performer (10‑24) | 25% + 10% team override | Team management, white-label assets, account manager, beta access. |
| Elite (25+) | 30% + custom | Co-marketing, strategic deals, VIP support, leadership council. |

Progress combines deals closed, training completion, support engagement, and satisfaction scores. Each tier section from the old PRD has been condensed into this table—if you need UX or copy details, read `docs/partners/pdr/partner-portal-master.md`.
