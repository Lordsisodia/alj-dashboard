## 🎯 What We're Building

**Product:** Discord-style mobile-first PWA for sales partners

**Key Features:**
- 💬 Real-time team chat (like Discord)
- 📊 Lead management with swipeable Kanban
- 💰 Commission tracking with real-time updates
- 🏆 Gamified tier progression (4 tiers)
- 📱 Installable PWA (works offline)
- 📚 Sales documentation & training
- 👥 Team management (recruit, track, earn overrides)

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TanStack Query + Zustand
- Supabase (DB + Realtime + Auth)
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Workbox (PWA)
- Sentry (monitoring)

## 🚨 Critical Discoveries

### **32 Gaps Found (All Solved)**

**🚨 CRITICAL (7):**
1. **No RLS policies** → Partner A could see Partner B's data!
2. **No XSS sanitization** → Chat vulnerable to script injection
3. **iOS Safari limitations** → No Push/BackgroundSync (50% of users!)
4. **Supabase limits** → 500 concurrent connections (app breaks at 501)
5. **No reconnection** → Connection drops = lost messages
6. **No conflict resolution** → Concurrent edits = data loss
7. **No error monitoring** → Production errors invisible

**⚠️ HIGH (7):**
8. File upload offline queue
9. Message ordering conflicts
10. Cross-tab sync
11. CSP headers
12. iPhone notch (safe areas)
13. Migration plan for 450 existing components
14. Performance monitoring

**📋 MEDIUM (8) + LOW (10):**
- Install analytics, cache versioning, reduced motion, network adaptation, scaffolding, CI/CD, bundle budgets, feature flags, etc.

## 🗓️ 10-Week Implementation Timeline

### **Week 0: Security (BEFORE ANY CODE)** 🔐
- Day 0.1: RLS policies on all tables
- Day 0.2: XSS sanitization + CSP + rate limiting
- Day 0.3: Sentry error monitoring

**Critical:** Do this FIRST or security breaches will happen!

---

### **Week 1: Infrastructure + iOS** 🏗️
- Directory structure (app/, features/, entities/, shared/)
- iOS Safari fallbacks (polling, in-app notifications, 50MB storage)
- Offline queue + file uploads
- Service worker versioning
- Path aliases + ESLint rules

---

### **Week 2: Real-Time Resilience** ⚡
- WebSocket reconnection (exponential backoff)
- Conflict resolution (concurrent edits)
- Supabase connection pooling (500 limit)
- Message ordering queue
- Cross-tab sync (BroadcastChannel)

---

### **Weeks 3-4: Core Features + Mobile** 📱
- Auth feature (login, register, RLS enforced)
- Dashboard feature (tier progression, stats)
- Leads feature (swipeable Kanban, conflict resolution)
- Mobile polish (notch, reduced motion, network adaptation)

---

### **Weeks 5-6: Migration** 🔄
- Incremental migration of 450 components
- Codemod automation
- High-traffic pages first
- Zero downtime

---

### **Weeks 7-8: Advanced Features** 🚀
- Chat (real-time messaging, presence)
- Team management
- Resources & training
- Commissions tracking

---

### **Weeks 9-10: Production Polish** ✨
- Performance optimization (bundle size, Web Vitals)
- Monitoring dashboard
- Feature flags
- CI/CD enforcement
- Beta testing with partners

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### **Option 1: Start Implementation (RECOMMENDED)** ⚡

I'll begin implementing:

**Day 0 (Today):**
1. Create RLS policies for all tables
2. Add XSS sanitization
3. Setup Sentry monitoring

**Week 1:**
4. Create directory structure
5. iOS fallbacks
6. Offline queue
7. Service worker

**Result:** Secure, resilient foundation in 1 week

---

### **Option 2: Review Documentation First** 📖

Read through:
1. MASTER-PRD (understand what we're building)
2. ARCHITECTURE-BLUEPRINT (understand patterns)
3. GAPS-ANALYSIS (understand risks)
4. IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE (understand roadmap)

Then start implementation.

---

### **Option 3: Prototype First** 🧪

Build a quick Discord-style UI mockup to visualize before building infrastructure.

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**START WITH OPTION 1** (Implementation)

**Why:**
- All planning done (32 gaps addressed)
- Security is time-critical (can't delay)
- Infrastructure first = faster features later
- You validated the vision already
- 10 weeks is realistic timeline

**What I'll Do Today:**
1. ✅ Create RLS policies (30 min)
2. ✅ Add XSS sanitization (15 min)
3. ✅ Setup Sentry (15 min)
4. ✅ Create directory structure (30 min)
5. ✅ Configure path aliases (15 min)
6. ✅ Setup ESLint rules (15 min)

**By tonight:** Secure foundation + clean architecture ready for features!

---

## ❓ Decision Time

**What do you want to do?**

A) **Start implementation now** (I'll begin with Week 0 security)
B) **Review docs first** (I'll explain anything unclear)
C) **Something else?**

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**After 10 weeks, you'll have:**
- ✅ Secure, scalable architecture
- ✅ Discord-style mobile PWA
- ✅ Works offline on iOS/Android
- ✅ Real-time collaboration
- ✅ 450 components organized
- ✅ Production-ready platform
- ✅ Ready for 500+ partners
